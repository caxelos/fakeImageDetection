TO DO:
	- des an uparxei kapoios pretrained encoder


DATA PREPROCESS:
	- 
	-
ENCODER:
	- input 256x256x3 image, output Nx1 feature (find optimal N)
	- find minimum output feature to have good accuracy
	- make a diagramm f(feature_size) = accuracy during encoder training

	*** interesting things **
	- how is back-propagation done. What about the feature vector in the 
	middle??
	

DECODER:
	- input Nx1 feature (find optimal N), output 256x256x3 image
	- Fully connected ANN
	
	*** interesting things ***
	


TRAINING:
	- get all project on google colab and edit the code there
